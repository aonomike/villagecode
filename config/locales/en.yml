# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  village_code_idea: "<p>When you walk with your head high , your confidence and conviction about what you are passionate about is undisputed. Village code is a journey of confidence and conviction that technology has the unmatched power of transforming and impacting communities even in the remotest parts of this world. The journey begun from the LakeHub co-working space, amidst the sweltering heat of the lakeside city of Kisumu, Kenya. A hub located 360km from the capital city of Nairobi, it was easy to notice that the region around the lake was not matching up technology-wise to the country's growth and the global pace. At, village code, we sought to bridge the divide to  make the region build its knowledge and skills and contribute towards the country's economy, and the world at large. We are constantly walking on the technology bridge, making it reachable, usable and transformative..</p>"
