## How to contribute
If youâ€™d like to add features (or bug fixes) to improve the example application, you can fork the repo and make pull requests.

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request

To keep you forked repo with the upstream repo read through [this for

It is advisable to use rvm for managing your ruby versions and create gemsets
for different rails versions
